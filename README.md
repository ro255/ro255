- 👋 Hi, I’m Rose, am a Tanzanian.
- 👀 I’m interested in  website development and mobile application.
- 💞️ am still learning daily to make sure that i can improve my skills. I like practising in programming to develop any solutions that can solve the problems of the people or society.
- I make sure that i can do it without giveup, because progrmamming language is very difficult but it need self commitment so as to meet goals and plans.
